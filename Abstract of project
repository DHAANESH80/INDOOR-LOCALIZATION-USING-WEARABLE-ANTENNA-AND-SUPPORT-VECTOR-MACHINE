For operational, safety, and security reasons. it is essential to track and locate people in the indoor environment precisely.
Due to the existence of physical obstructions, RF interference, and limited GPS satellite sight, indoor tracking, and localization is a
difficult task. 
An indoor localization and tracking system that uses wearable
technology and machine learning to precisely track and locate people.
The solution has high accuracy, low latency, and resilient performance in challenging indoor
circumstances. 
Path loss magnitude and RMS delay spread, two-channel properties are
suggested as classification features to be applied to the ML model to effectively
categorize the off-body channel links into LOS and NLOS scenarios. 
The model's performance is evaluated by comparing the predicted locations with the actual
locations. The system is designed to be low-cost and highly scalable. 
The result of the project will show that the system accurately and reliably determines the location of a
the person within an indoor environment
