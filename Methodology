Proposed Methodology

1.Designing of Antenna: EMPro Software, which is effective for designing and simulating
antennas, is used to design microstrip antenna. The antenna is designed with desired
frequency.

2.Data Collection: The first step is to collect data using the designed wearable antenna. The
data collection should be performed at various locations within the indoor environment to
obtain a comprehensive dataset.

3.Pre-processing: The collected data must be pre-processed to remove any errors or
outliers. This step includes normalizing the data to ensure that the values are consistent and
within a specific range.

4.Feature Extraction: The next step is to extract relevant features from the pre-processed
data. Path loss magnitude and RMS delay spread are suggested as two channel parameters
that can be applied to the ML algorithm to correctly categorize into LOS and NLOS
situations. The selected features will be used to train the machine learning model.

5.Model Selection: The next step is to choose a machine learning model that is appropriate
for this problem. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a suitable choice for this problem as it
is effective in classification problems.

6.Model Training: The selected machine learning model is then trained using the extracted
features. The SVM model is trained using the training data, and the parameters are optimized
to obtain the best accuracy.

7.Model Testing: Once the model has been trained, it is tested using a separate dataset,
known as the testing data. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the
predicted coordinates with the actual coordinates.

8.Deployment: The final step is to deploy the trained model in the indoor environment. The
wearable antenna can be used to continuously collect data and the SVM model can be used to
predict the coordinates of the antenna in the indoor environment.

This methodology can be used to accurately predict the location of a person or object using a
wearable antenna and Support Vector Machine within an indoor environment using a Support
Vector Machine model.
